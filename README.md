# Road-Hazard-Detection-Real-Time-Alerts
Real-time AI system for detecting road hazards like potholes, speed breakers, and stalled vehicles using YOLOv8
This project aims to improve road safety on Indian roads by using Artificial Intelligence for real-time hazard detection.
The system processes dashcam or smartphone video feeds to detect common road hazards such as potholes, speed breakers, stalled vehicles, and debris.
It  sends instant alerts

Built using YOLOv8 for fast object detection and OpenCV for image processing, the project demonstrates how AI can transform ordinary road videos into actionable safety intelligence.

Ideal for smart vehicle systems, ADAS (Advanced Driver Assistance Systems), and intelligent traffic monitoring.
