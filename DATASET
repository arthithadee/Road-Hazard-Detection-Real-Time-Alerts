# RDD2020 – Road Damage Dataset 2020

**RDD2020 (Road Damage Dataset 2020)** is a large-scale, multi-country road damage image dataset created to support the development of **deep learning-based road damage detection and classification systems**.

---

## Overview

- **Total Images:** 26,336  
- **Total Annotations:** Over 31,000 instances of road damage  
- **Image Type:** Real-world road images captured under varying lighting and surface conditions  
- **Purpose:** Benchmark dataset for training and evaluating deep learning models in road damage detection and classification  

---

## Countries Covered

- India  
- Japan  
- Czech Republic  

The **Indian subset** is particularly valuable for **real-time pothole detection applications**, as it includes local road conditions such as:
- Uneven surfaces  
- Drainage damage  
- Monsoon-related potholes  

---

## Data Collection

Images were captured using **smartphones mounted on vehicles**, simulating real-world driving conditions.  
This makes the dataset suitable for **dash-cam** or **mobile-based AI applications**.

Each image is accompanied by **bounding-box annotations** that specify the type and location of road damage.

---

## Annotation Details

Each annotation includes:  
- **Class label** (damage type)  
- **Bounding-box coordinates** (for object detection models such as YOLOv8)

### Damage Categories

| Code | Damage Type          | Description                                           |
|------|---------------------|-------------------------------------------------------|
| D00  | Longitudinal Cracks  | Cracks running along the road’s length               |
| D10  | Transverse Cracks    | Cracks running across the road’s width               |
| D20  | Alligator Cracks     | Interconnected cracks forming a pattern like alligator skin |
| D40  | Potholes             | Depressions or holes in the road surface caused by wear or water damage |

---

## Applications

- Road damage classification and localization  
- Automated maintenance reporting  
- Real-time pothole detection systems  
- Benchmarking of deep learning models for road inspection tasks
