RDD2020 (Road Damage Dataset 2020) is a large-scale, multi-country road damage image dataset for developing deep learning-based road damage detection and classification systems.

Contains 26,336 road images and over 31,000 annotated instances of road damage.

Images cover a variety of road types, surfaces, and lighting conditions.

Intended as a benchmark for training and evaluating deep learning models.

Countries included: India, Japan, Czech Republic.

The Indian subset is useful for real-time pothole detection as it captures uneven surfaces, drainage damage, and monsoon-related potholes.

Images were captured using smartphones mounted on vehicles, simulating real-world driving conditions.

Suitable for dash-cam or mobile-based AI applications.

Each image has bounding-box annotations specifying damage type and location.

Annotations include class labels and bounding-box coordinates (compatible with YOLOv8).

Damage categories:

D00: Longitudinal cracks (cracks along road length)

D10: Transverse cracks (cracks across road width)

D20: Alligator cracks (interconnected cracks forming alligator skin pattern)

D40: Potholes (depressions or holes caused by wear or water damage)

Applications: road damage classification and localization, automated maintenance reporting, real-time pothole detection systems, benchmarking deep learning models for road inspection.
